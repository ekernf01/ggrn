A Docker container with a simple baseline that ignores genetic perturbations and returns cells of the specified `cell_type` and `timepoint`, simulated forward by the desired number of steps (`prediction_timescale`). Simulations are run using the matching done by GGRN -- see `ggrn.api.match_controls` docs. Starting from a certain cell C, we select all cells among the next timepoint that give C as their matched control. We chose one at random. We repeat this for `prediction_timescale` steps.
