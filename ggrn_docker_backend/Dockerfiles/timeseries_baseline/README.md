A Docker container with a simple baseline that ignores genetic perturbations and returns cells of the specified `cell_type` and `timepoint`, simulated forward by the desired number of steps (`prediction_timescale`). Simulations are run using the matching done by GGRN -- we take the specified cells, find all the matches, find the most abundant cell type, and return all cells of that type. We repeat this for `prediction_timescale` steps.
